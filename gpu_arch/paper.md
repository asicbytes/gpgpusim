## Introduction

Confocal microscopy is an essential tool for examining cellular structures in biological research. However, obtaining high-quality images with good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) remains challenging due to the fundamental trade-off between image quality and potential photodamage to sensitive biological specimens. When imaging delicate samples such as flatworms, even standard laser intensities can cause specimen flinching, forcing researchers to use lower laser powers that result in noisy images.

This trade-off between image quality and acquisition parameters (including laser power, exposure time, and scanning speed) has motivated the development of computational approaches to enhance microscopy images. These approaches include denoising, deblurring, and optical deconvolution techniques. While hardware-based solutions exist, such as structured illumination microscopy (SIM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), and light-sheet microscopy, they typically require expensive equipment and specialized expertise that may not be accessible to many research laboratories.

Deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative for microscopy image enhancement. While many models can denoise 2D confocal microscopy images, they often do not take the underlying physics of the microscopy imaging process into consideration, which can lead to two significant limitations. First, they can suffer from hallucinations, potentially generating unrealistic details and artifacts that can mislead researchers. Second, these models often have large parameter counts, ranging from millions to billions, which can require substantial computational resources.

Recent work has introduced physics-informed deep neural networks that incorporate knowledge of the imaging process into neural network design, improving performance while reducing computational requirements. The DeBCR model, based on Beylkin-Coifman-Rokhlin wavelet theory, approximates the inverse operator needed for image restoration. This physics-informed approach enables DeBCR to perform denoising tasks without requiring explicit knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF) parameters, which is particularly valuable since these parameters can be difficult to determine accurately for each imaging session.

This paper explores the application of the physics-informed DeBCR model for denoising 2D confocal microscopy images of flatworms. Our approach recovers high-quality images from noisy inputs while avoiding false patterns, achieving high PSNR and SSIM scores with computational efficiency. The paper is structured as follows: Section II presents our motivation and the physics-based derivation of our neural network architecture. Section III describes our dataset and training methodology. Section IV details our experimental results and frequency domain analysis. Section V concludes with future work and implications of our findings.
